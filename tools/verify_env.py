"""Pre-lab environment check. Run this BEFORE the session, not during it.

    uv run python tools/verify_env.py

On success it prints a token. Paste that token into Moodle before the lab.
Setup that fails in the room costs the whole room time, which is why this is
homework.

Checks, in order of how often they fail:
  1. Python >= 3.13
  2. uv-managed environment with dependencies resolved
  3. .env exists and is NOT tracked by git
  4. exactly one model provider key present, matching LLM_MODEL
  5. the model key actually works (one tiny live call)
  6. GITHUB_TOKEN present and valid
  7. git identity configured
  8. pre-commit hook installed
  9. Node present, and pyright actually runs

    #                         commit dies with "exec: python: not found".

    #                         Windows, where git runs hooks under Git Bash and a
    #                         backslashed drive path is not executable there.
